## SQL Normalization and Denormalization 
Normalization and denormalization are two key concepts in database management. They relate to data organization and system performance.

### **Normalization...**
Involves structuring data within a database to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.
- Example:
Consider a database table named 'customers' storing customer details like name, address, and phone number. Normalization involves dividing this table into 'customers' and 'addresses' tables, linked via a foreign key, to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.

### **Denormalization...** 
Involves introducing redundant data into a database to enhance system performance. It improves the readability of any queries but may sacrifice writing performance, I.e. The schema may have more duplicates (redundant data).
- Example:
In an 'orders' table containing customer orders with customer name and address, denormalization can entail adding duplicate columns for customer details. This eliminates the need for table joins, thereby improving query performance.

### Considerations:
   - Data Redundancy:
     Denormalization introduces redundancy, potentially complicating data maintenance.
   - Performance vs. Integrity:
     Denormalization trades off some data integrity for improved performance and should be employed judiciously.
   - Use Cases:
     Denormalization is suitable for scenarios where performance gains outweigh concerns about redundancy and integrity.

Conclusion:
Understanding the distinction between normalization and denormalization is crucial for effective database management. While normalization prioritizes data integrity through minimizing redundancy, denormalization optimizes performance with an allowance for redundant data. Both approaches have their place.
