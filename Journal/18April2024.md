## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Today's learning focussed on Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Through DataCamp, I explored how CTEs can streamline complex queries, making them more readable and easier to manage. 

As I delved into the NBA dataset in practice, I devised a simple SQL query using CTEs to find teams with an average points per game (PPG) greater than 100 ðŸ”½ This not only solidified my understanding of CTEs but also opened my eyes to their practical applications in real-world scenarios. 
 
```sql
-- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the average points per game (PPG) for each team

WITH TeamPPG AS (
    SELECT team_name, AVG(points) AS avg_ppg
    FROM players
    GROUP BY team_name
)

-- Select teams with an average PPG greater than 100
SELECT team_name
FROM TeamPPG
WHERE avg_ppg > 100;

```

Another example of using a CTE to good effect is shown in the coffee company example below. I find it very useful as it makes the investigation much easier to read and follow:

```sql
-- Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate total sales for each product category
WITH ProductSales AS (
    SELECT category, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY category
)

-- Select product categories with total sales greater than $1000
SELECT category
FROM ProductSales
WHERE total_sales > 1000;
```

### <ins> Advantages of CTEs </ins> 
- **Readability**: 
  - CTEs make SQL queries more readable by breaking them into smaller, logical parts, enhancing code comprehension and maintenance.

- **Reusability**:
  - CTEs can be referenced multiple times within a single query, avoiding redundancy and improving query efficiency.

- **Clarity**:
  - CTEs provide a clear, named structure for temporary result sets, making the query logic easier to understand compared to nested subqueries.
