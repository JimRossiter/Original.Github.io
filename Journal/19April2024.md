## Window Functions with Over & Partition By

Today, I learned about Window functions and their uses. Window functions in SQL allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without grouping the rows into a single output row. They are particularly useful for calculating running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

In the example below, the `SUM()` window function is used along with the `OVER()` clause to calculate the running total of quantities sold for each product over time.

Here's the example with explanation:

```sql
-- Sample data
WITH sales AS (
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-01' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 10 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-02' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 5 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-03' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 8 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-01' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 7 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-02' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 12 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-03' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 6 AS quantity
)

-- Calculate running total of quantities sold for each product
SELECT
    date,
    product,
    quantity,
    SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM
    sales;
```

ðŸ”¼ Explanation:
- `SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date)`: This line calculates the running total of quantities sold for each product.
  - `SUM(quantity)` calculates the sum of quantities sold.
  - `OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date)` defines the window over which the sum is calculated.
    - `PARTITION BY product` ensures that the sum is reset for each product.
    - `ORDER BY date` ensures that the sum is calculated in chronological order.
- `WITH sales AS (...)`: This is a common table expression (CTE) used to define sample data without creating a physical table. It allows you to easily provide data for demonstration purposes without altering your database schema

I also worked through this example below which greatly helped my understanding ðŸ”½ðŸ‘Œ

We have a dataset of sales transactions for a retail store, and we want to calculate the total sales for each day along with the percentage of sales each product category contributes to the total sales for that day. 

```sql
SELECT
    transaction_date,
    product_category,
    SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_date) AS total_sales,
    sales_amount * 100.0 / SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_date) AS percentage_of_total_sales
FROM
    sales_transactions;
```

Explanation:ðŸ”½

In the query:
- `SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_date) AS total_sales`: This part calculates the total sales for each day by summing up the `sales_amount` for all transactions that occurred on the same `transaction_date`. The `PARTITION BY` clause divides the data into partitions based on `transaction_date`.
- `sales_amount * 100.0 / SUM(sales_amount) OVER (PARTITION BY transaction_date) AS percentage_of_total_sales`: This part calculates the percentage of total sales that each product category contributes to the total sales for each day. It divides the `sales_amount` for each transaction by the total sales for that day (calculated in the previous step) and multiplies by 100 to get the percentage.

This query helps us understand the contribution of each product category to the total sales for each day, allowing the business to identify which categories are driving sales on specific days.
