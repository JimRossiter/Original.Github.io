Today, I learned about Window functions and their used in calculating running totals. They are very useful in keeping track of particular products, medals won, games won etc. Window functions in SQL allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without grouping the rows into a single output row. They are particularly useful for calculating running totals, rankings, and moving averages.

In the example below, the `SUM()` window function is used along with the `OVER()` clause to calculate the running total of quantities sold for each product over time.

Here's the example with explanation:

```sql
-- Sample data
WITH sales AS (
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-01' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 10 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-02' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 5 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-03' AS date, 'Product A' AS product, 8 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-01' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 7 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-02' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 12 AS quantity UNION ALL
    SELECT DATE '2024-04-03' AS date, 'Product B' AS product, 6 AS quantity
)

-- Calculate running total of quantities sold for each product
SELECT
    date,
    product,
    quantity,
    SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date) AS running_total
FROM
    sales;
```

ðŸ”¼ Explanation:
- `SUM(quantity) OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date)`: This line calculates the running total of quantities sold for each product.
  - `SUM(quantity)` calculates the sum of quantities sold.
  - `OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date)` defines the window over which the sum is calculated.
    - `PARTITION BY product` ensures that the sum is reset for each product.
    - `ORDER BY date` ensures that the sum is calculated in chronological order.
- `WITH sales AS (...)`: This is a common table expression (CTE) used to define sample data without creating a physical table. It allows you to easily provide data for demonstration purposes without altering your database schema.
