## Exploring Date & Time functions

Today, I looked at and practiced SQL date functions on DataCamp. Specifically, I learned about `EXTRACT`, `DATE_PART`, and `DATE_TRUNC`. Let me break down each one and provide examples using a hypothetical coffee shop dataset with five transactions.

| transaction_id | transaction_date | transaction_time | amount |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
|       1        |   2024-04-23     |     09:15:00     |   20   |
|       2        |   2024-04-23     |     10:30:00     |   25   |
|       3        |   2024-04-23     |     11:45:00     |   30   |
|       4        |   2024-04-23     |     12:00:00     |   15   |
|       5        |   2024-04-23     |     13:15:00     |   10   |


**1. `EXTRACT`:**

`EXTRACT` is used to extract specific components from a date or time, such as year, month, day, etc.

Example:
```sql
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS transaction_year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) AS transaction_month
FROM transactions;
```

Output:
```
| transaction_year | transaction_month |
|------------------|-------------------|
|      2024        |         4         |
|      2024        |         4         |
|      2024        |         4         |
|      2024        |         4         |
|      2024        |         4         |
```

**2. `DATE_PART`:**

`DATE_PART` extracts specific date or time parts from a given date or time value.

Example:
```sql
SELECT DATE_PART('hour', transaction_time) AS transaction_hour,
       DATE_PART('minute', transaction_time) AS transaction_minute
FROM transactions;
```

Output:
```
| transaction_hour | transaction_minute |
|------------------|--------------------|
|        9         |         15         |
|       10         |         30         |
|       11         |         45         |
|       12         |         0          |
|       13         |         15         |
```

**3. `DATE_TRUNC`:**

`DATE_TRUNC` truncates a date or time value to a specified level of precision.

Example:
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS truncated_month,
       SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY truncated_month;
```

Output:
```
| truncated_month | total_amount |
|-----------------|--------------|
|   2024-04-01    |     100      |
```

**Summary Notes:**

- `EXTRACT`: Useful for extracting specific components like year, month, etc., from date or time values.
- `DATE_PART`: Extracts specific parts of date or time values such as hour, minute, etc.
- `DATE_TRUNC`: Truncates date or time values to a specified precision like month, day, etc.

## `DATE_TRUNC` continued....

This function was tricky for me to grasp initially but I explored further examples to come to come to terms with it.

I practiced by looking at a transactions table with transactions spanning multiple months:

**Transactions Table:**

| transaction_id | transaction_date | transaction_time | amount |
|----------------|------------------|------------------|--------|
|       1        |   2024-03-15     |     09:15:00     |   20   |
|       2        |   2024-03-23     |     10:30:00     |   25   |
|       3        |   2024-04-05     |     11:45:00     |   30   |
|       4        |   2024-04-12     |     12:00:00     |   15   |
|       5        |   2024-05-01     |     13:15:00     |   10   |

Then, I used `DATE_TRUNC` to calculate the total amount of transactions truncated by month:

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS truncated_month,
       SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM transactions
GROUP BY truncated_month;
```

Output:
```
| truncated_month | total_amount |
|-----------------|--------------|
|   2024-03-01    |     45       |
|   2024-04-01    |     45       |
|   2024-05-01    |     10       |
```

In this example, `DATE_TRUNC` is used to truncate transaction dates to the month level, allowing us to summarize the total amount of transactions for each month.
