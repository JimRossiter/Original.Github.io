## Pivoting Data in SQL

In SQL, a pivot operation is used to convert rows of data into columns. It rotates a table-valued expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output. This transformation is useful when you want to rotate data.

Pivoting is useful in various scenarios:

1. **Organising Data:** When you want to organise data based on certain criteria and display the results in a more readable format.

2. **Data Presentation:** It helps in presenting data in a more concise and understandable manner, especially for reporting purposes.

3. **Comparing Data:** Pivoting allows you to compare different categories or groups of data more easily by placing them side by side in columns.


Overall, pivot operations provide flexibility in data analysis and reporting by restructuring data to suit specific needs.

### **Example: Food Diary** 

The table below shows a food diary for a range of dates.

| ID |   Date   | Food Eaten | Amount Eaten |
|----|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1  | 21-04-24 | Apples     | 2            |
| 2  | 21-04-24 | Sandwich   | 1            |
| 3  | 22-04-24 | Oranges    | 3            |
| 4  | 22-04-24 | Soup       | 1            |
| 5  | 23-04-24 | Sandwich   | 1            |
| 6  | 24-04-24 | Apples     | 1            |
| 7  | 24-04-24 | Soup       | 1            |
| 8  | 25-04-24 | Oranges    | 2            |
| 9  | 25-04-24 | Sandwich   | 1            |
| 10 | 26-04-24 | Apples     | 2            |

What if I wanted to see this presented day by day instead of individual food consumption entries? What if instead of the way it's presented now, I'd rather see sandwiches, apples, oranges and soup as columns? 

I can achieve this with a convenient function called **PIVOT**.

To pivot the table using the `CROSSTAB` function, you'll need to use a database system that supports it, such as PostgreSQL with the `tablefunc` extension. Here's how you can use `CROSSTAB`:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;

SELECT * FROM CROSSTAB(
    'SELECT Date, Food_Eaten, Amount_Eaten FROM food_diary ORDER BY 1,2'
) AS ct (Date DATE, Apples INT, Oranges INT, Soup INT, Sandwich INT);
```

In this query:

- We first ensure that the `tablefunc` extension is enabled.
- Then we use a subquery to fetch the data from the `food_diary` table, ordering it by the date and food eaten.
- Finally, we apply the `CROSSTAB` function to pivot the data. The resulting columns are named after each food type (Apples, Oranges, Soup, Sandwich), and the amounts eaten are shown under each respective column.

The output looks as follows:
| Date       | Apples | Oranges | Soup | Sandwich |
|------------|--------|---------|------|----------|
| 21-04-24   | 2      | 0       | 0    | 1        |
| 22-04-24   | 0      | 3       | 1    | 0        |
| 23-04-24   | 0      | 0       | 0    | 1        |
| 24-04-24   | 1      | 0       | 1    | 0        |
| 25-04-24   | 0      | 2       | 0    | 1        |
| 26-04-24   | 2      | 0       | 0    | 0        |
