## Using ROLLUP & CUBE with GROUP BY

Today, I looked further into examples dealing with the GROUP BY clause. They are very useful in streamlining complex data and makes it much easier to scan and interpret.

In SQL, both `ROLLUP` and `CUBE` are used for generating summary reports. 

- **ROLLUP**: It performs on multiple levels of grouping columns, producing subtotals for each level of grouping. It’s like rolling up the data and calculating totals at various levels.

- **CUBE**: It generates all possible combinations of grouping sets, providing subtotals for each combination. It’s like creating a multidimensional set of subtotals.

### **Example:**
Here's an example using a coffee shop with three products (coffee, tea, and pastries) sold in two store locations (Store A and Store B):

**ROLLUP Example:**

```sql
SELECT Store, Product, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Store, Product);
```

Output:
```
Store    | Product   | TotalSales
---------------------------------
Store A  | Coffee    | 100
Store A  | Tea       | 50
Store A  | Pastries  | 75
Store A  | NULL      | 225
Store B  | Coffee    | 120
Store B  | Tea       | 70
Store B  | Pastries  | 90
Store B  | NULL      | 280
NULL     | NULL      | 505
```

**CUBE Example:**

```sql
SELECT Store, Product, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM Sales
GROUP BY CUBE (Store, Product);
```

Output:
```
Store    | Product   | TotalSales
---------------------------------
Store A  | Coffee    | 100
Store A  | Tea       | 50
Store A  | Pastries  | 75
Store A  | NULL      | 225
Store B  | Coffee    | 120
Store B  | Tea       | 70
Store B  | Pastries  | 90
Store B  | NULL      | 280
NULL     | Coffee    | 220
NULL     | Tea       | 120
NULL     | Pastries  | 165
NULL     | NULL      | 505
```

In both examples, NULL represents the subtotal at each level, and the last row represents the grand total.
