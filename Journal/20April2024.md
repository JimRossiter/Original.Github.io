## Understanding SQL Frames 

Today, I explored SQL frames, a concept that adds a whole new dimension to querying data. Frames in SQL are essentially a way to define a window or subset of rows within a result set. These frames allow you to perform calculations, comparisons, and aggregations on specific portions of your data, rather than the entire dataset.

I will discuss the use of frames in the 2 examples below and summarise their main uses in SQL at the end of this text.


```sql
WITH Scandinavian_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Year, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country IN ('DEN', 'NOR', 'FIN', 'SWE', 'ISL')
    AND Medal = 'Gold'
  GROUP BY Year)

SELECT
  -- Select each year's medals
  YEAR,
  Medals,
  -- Get the max of the current and next years'  medals
  max(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR ASC
             ROWS BETWEEN current ROW
             AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS Max_Medals
FROM Scandinavian_Medals
ORDER BY Year ASC;
```
ðŸ”¼ **Example 1: Scandinavian Medals**

The query selects data from the table Summer_Medals where the country is one of the Scandinavian countries (DEN, NOR, FIN, SWE, ISL) and the medal is gold.
It groups the data by year and counts the number of gold medals for each year.
The outer query then selects each year's medals along with the count (Medals).
It uses a window function max() to calculate the maximum number of medals between the current year and the following year (1 FOLLOWING). This is done for each row, ordered by the year in ascending order.


**ðŸ”½ Example 2: Chinese Medals**

The query selects data from the table Summer_Medals where the country is China (CHN), the medal is gold, and the year is 2000 or later.
It groups the data by athlete and counts the number of gold medals for each athlete.
The outer query then selects each athlete along with the count of medals (Medals).
It uses a window function max() to calculate the maximum number of medals among the current athlete and the two preceding athletes (2 PRECEDING). This is done for each row, ordered by athlete name in ascending order.
```sql
WITH Chinese_Medals AS (
  SELECT
    Athlete, COUNT(*) AS Medals
  FROM Summer_Medals
  WHERE
    Country = 'CHN' AND Medal = 'Gold'
    AND Year >= 2000
  GROUP BY Athlete)

SELECT
  -- Select the athletes and the medals they've earned
  Athlete,
  Medals,
  -- Get the max of the last two and current rows' medals 
  max(Medals) OVER (ORDER BY Athlete ASC
            ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING            AND Current ROW) AS Max_Medals
FROM Chinese_Medals
ORDER BY Athlete ASC;
```
In both examples, the max() function with the OVER clause and ROWS frame is used to perform a calculation over a specific subset of rows defined by the frame. This allows for dynamic calculations based on the ordering of the data and the specified frame, providing insights such as the maximum number of medals within a certain range of rows.

## **Uses of Frames:**

Frames in SQL are incredibly versatile and can be used for various purposes, including:

**Calculating Running Totals:** As shown in Example 1, frames can be used to calculate cumulative sums or running totals over a specified range of rows.

**Calculating Moving Averages:** Example 2 demonstrates how frames can be used to compute moving averages by considering a sliding window of rows.

**Analyzing Trends:** Frames allow for analyzing trends or patterns within a dataset by aggregating or comparing data within specific subsets.

**Ranking and Window Functions:** Frames are also integral to performing ranking operations and applying window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and NTILE().

## NTILE()
The `NTILE` function in SQL is used to divide the result set into a specified number of roughly equal-sized groups, assigning a group number to each row based on a specified ordering. 

For example, if you have 100 rows of data and you specify `NTILE(4)`, the result set will be divided into four groups, with each group containing approximately 25 rows (assuming there are no remainder rows). The rows within each group will be ordered based on the specified ordering.

This function is commonly used for tasks such as ranking, percentile calculation, or dividing data into quartiles, quintiles, deciles, etc., depending on the specified number of groups.
