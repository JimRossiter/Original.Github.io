## The difference between ROW and RANGE in Windows 

In SQL window functions, a "row" refers to a single row of data within the window frame, while a "range" refers to an interval of rows within the frame based on their values. 

When using "row", the function operates on individual rows, considering each row separately within the window.

On the other hand, when using "range" as the window frame specification, the function operates on an interval of rows based on their values. **This means that rows with the same value within the specified range will be treated as a single entity.**

## **Example:**
### *ROW*

```sql
SELECT
  period,
  shop,
  revenue,
  SUM(revenue) OVER(
    PARTITION BY shop
    ORDER BY period ASC
    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  ) AS rows_cumulative_revenue
FROM revenue_consolidation;
```

This is quite straight forward. Each row is treated separately and the cumulative sum is found by adding each value to the previous combined total for each row.

### *Range*

```sql
SELECT
  period,
  shop,
  revenue,
  SUM(revenue) OVER(
    PARTITION BY shop
    ORDER BY period ASC
    RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  ) AS range_cumulative_revenue
FROM revenue_consolidation;
```

There are two rows that both contain revenue for 2021/06 at Shop 1, and they will be treated together by adding them up. That way, there will be only one value for the cumulative revenue for the month. This matches how it works in the real world: there is only one cumulative value at the end of the month.
