## Star Schema & Snowflake Schema 

Advancing my learning in database design and looking at the different ways of storing data was challenging. It was interesting yo note that the best design depends on who is using the data and how it will be used. Other factors that need to be considered are the level of normalisation required, time constraints and storage space.  

As an analyst, I recognise the importance of having data that is accurate, concise and efficient; this leads to shorter query runtimes and easier readability. 

## **Structure:** 
### Star Schema: 
Centralized fact table surrounded by dimension tables, forming a star-like structure.

Dimension tables describe the things you model. Entities can include products, people, places, and concepts including time.

Fact tables store observations or events, and can be sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, temperatures, etc. A fact table contains dimension key columns that relate to dimension tables, and numeric measure columns.

### Snowflake Schema: 
Fact table connected to dimension tables, with further normalization, creating a snowflake-like structure.

## **Advantages:** 
### Star Schema:
  - Simple and easy to understand.
  - Optimized for quick data retrieval.
  - Suitable for less complex queries.

### Snowflake Schema:
  - Allows for more data storage as the data is normalised and very structured.
  - Suits complex data analysis needs.
  - Enables better data integrity and flexibility.

## **Use Cases:**
### Star Schema:
  - Ideal for data warehouses with less complex query requirements.
  - Well-suited for reporting and simple analytics tasks.

### Snowflake Schema:
  - Best for data warehouses with complex analytical needs.
  - Beneficial for organizations requiring in-depth data analysis and exploration.
  - Offers better support for large-scale data sets and intricate relationships.

*The purpose of the Star Schema is to reduce duplicates or data being repeated in the fact gable unneccesarily. E.g. User name.*

*The Snowflake Schema is an extension of the Star Schema. It is easier to adapt but requires more joins to analyse the data. This slows down query time.*
