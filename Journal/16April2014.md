## Using CASE WHEN with Aggregate functions

Today, I delved into using CASE WHEN queries to categorize data based on certain conditions and then computing percentages within those categories. It was a more alternative approach than I was expecting but makes alot of sense now that I have applied it to a real life example.

I explored incorporating the ROUND and AVG functions to refine my percentage calculations and ensure precision in my results. It's crucial to have accurate data representation, especially when dealing with percentages.

```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
ðŸ”¼ We wanted to find out the percentage of games in each country that ended in a draw; for 3 different seasons. '1' was assigned for the desired outcome - a draw. '0' was assigned to wins and losses. Employing this neat trick enabled us to calculate the draw percentage.
