## Sliding Windows

Sliding windows in SQL, also known as moving or rolling windows, allow you to perform calculations over a fixed number of preceding or following rows relative to the current row. They're useful for calculating moving averages or cumulative sums over a fixed period 

Today we looked at the moving average of points earned by each team over a 5-match window:

```sql
-- Calculate moving average of points earned by each team over a 5-match window
SELECT
    match_date,
    team,
    points,
    AVG(points) OVER (PARTITION BY team ORDER BY match_date ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg
FROM
    premier_league_standings;
```

Explanation ðŸ”½

- `AVG(points) OVER (PARTITION BY team ORDER BY match_date ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)`: This line calculates the moving average of points earned by each team over a 5-match window.
  - `OVER (PARTITION BY team ORDER BY match_date ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)` defines the sliding window over which the average is calculated.
    - `PARTITION BY team` ensures that the average is reset for each team.
    - `ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` specifies the range of rows included in the window. In this case, it includes the current row and the four preceding rows, forming a 5-match window.

This query will return the match date, team name, points earned in each match, and the moving average of points earned by each team over a 5-match window, using the provided dataset `premier_league_standings`.
